    This decorator is used in conjunction with RequestTokens and the
    RequestTokenMiddleware. By the time that a request has passed through the
    middleware and reached the view function, if a RequestToken exists it will
    have been decoded, and the payload added to the request as `token_payload`.

    This decorator is then used to map the `sub` JWT token claim to the function
    using the 'scope' kwarg - the scope must be provided, and must match the
    scope of the request token.

    If the 'required' kwarg is True, then the view function expects a valid token
    in all cases - and the decorator will raise TokenNotFoundError if one does
    not exist.

    Errors are trapped and returned as HttpResponseForbidden responses, with
    the original error as the `response.error` property.

    For more details on decorators with optional args, see:
    https://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/inapickle/2012/01/05/python-decorators-with-optional-arguments/
